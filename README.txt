Here you will find sundry code, some of which is referenced on my website,

but more generally, I provide these in the hope that they will be
useful or interesting, as they are to me.  The code should include
some help documentation describing purpose or usage.  Please contact
me (by email, slivingston@caltech.edu) with questions, comments, etc.

Note that files ending with *.m (e.g., estfreq.m) are Octave/Matlab
scripts. They should run unaltered in either environment, with the
possible addition or removal of fflush(stdout), which I use to get
around Octave's buffering of script output.

Cheers!
